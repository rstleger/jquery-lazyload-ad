# jQuery LazyLoad Ad - Implement a clever Ad Distribution ! #

jQuery LazyLoad Ad is a jQuery plugin that takes advantage of LazyLoad delaying ads loading.<br>
<ul><li>Highly improve general page load (Ads are displayed after the page load and only inside the viewport)<br>
</li><li>Compatibility with AdSense and many other advertisers<br>
</li><li>Cross Browser support (IE5.5+, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari)<br></li></ul>

Gains on my blog : 65% for the page load, and 52% for page weight<br>
-> Without lazyLoad Ad : Page loaded in 8.88s (371.98kb)<br>
-> With : page loaded and accessible in 3.17s (179.18kb)<br>
